Using Infura.io: https://infura.io/

## How To Use

This project relies on an Ethereum provider to access data from the main network.

This app will first try to access any injected Web3 provider like that included with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/).

Do note though, that if you want to use the injected Web3 provider, you [must host this page on a local webserver](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/46399/unable-to-connect-to-metamask-using-web3), not just open the html file on your local filesystem.

Otherwise, you can provide an HTTP Web3 provider using a free API key generated by [Infura](https://infura.io/) or similar services. You will need to replace `<APIKEY>` in this project.
